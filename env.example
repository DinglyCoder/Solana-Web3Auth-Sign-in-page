# Note: For Plug and Play Web3Auth, all authentication and session management 
# is handled client-side. No server-side configuration is needed.
# 
# Social providers (Google, Twitter, Discord, GitHub) are configured 
# directly in the Web3Auth Dashboard, not through environment variables.
# 
# No JWT secrets or individual OAuth client IDs are needed - Web3Auth 
# handles all authentication flows internally.
